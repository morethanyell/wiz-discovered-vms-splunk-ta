# Wiz Discovered Virtual Machines Splunk Technology Add-on (TA)

## Overview
The Wiz Virtual Machines Splunk TA is designed to collect and ingest logs from Wiz's Cloud Resource Inventory, specifically targeting discovered Virtual Machines. This TA simplifies the process of retrieving and analyzing your cloud infrastructure data within Splunk.

## Features
Automated creation and retrieval of Wiz reports.
Ingests discovered Virtual Machines from Wiz as individual Splunk events.
Extracts and uses the "Last Seen" timestamp from the CSV report for each event.

## Requirements
- Splunk Enterprise 9.x or later
- Access to Wiz's Cloud Resource Inventory
- Wiz Client ID credentials with permissions to create and retrieve reports

## Installation

Upload the downloaded package and click Upload.
Restart Splunk if prompted.

## Configuration

## How It Works
- The TA generates a report in Wiz's Cloud Resource Inventory.
- It waits for the report to be completed.
- Once the report is complete, it retrieves the report in CSV format.
- Each row of the CSV is ingested as an individual Splunk event.
- The timestamp for each event is derived from the "Last Seen" field in the CSV.
